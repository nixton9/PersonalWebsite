Hey guys! üòÅ  
Today I'll show you how to create a classic ribbon with some CSS. Ribbons are a fancy element that are commonly used in things like pop-ups, headers, etc. I'll show you how to do a pretty basic one but you can then easily customize it for it to look whatever you want to.

In terms of HTML we only need a div with the class 'ribbon' and inside it we'll have a span wrapping all of our text.

 ```html
 
    <div class="ribbon">

        <span>Follow @webdev.tips on Instagram!</span>

    </div>        
 ```

Then we need some CSS to get things going. I won't go into much detail on this styles, because all of the rules are pretty straightforward. Basically what we're doing here is using the pseudo-elements 'before' and 'after' on our div and on our span to be able to create the ribbon flaps.

 ```css
.ribbon {
    position: relative;
    width: 70%;
    color: #fff;
    background: #8225E2;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 15px 20px;
    font-size: 15px;
    border-radius: 2px;
    letter-spacing: .1em;
}

.ribbon:before, .ribbon:after {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    bottom: -15px;
    border: 23px solid #6814bf;
    z-index: -1;
}

.ribbon:before {
    left: -30px;
    border-right-width: 23px;
    border-left-color: transparent;
}

.ribbon:after {
    right: -30px;
    border-left-width: 23px;
    border-right-color: transparent;
}

.ribbon span:before, .ribbon span:after {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: #340b5f transparent transparent transparent;
    bottom: -15px;
}

.ribbon span:before {
    left: 0;
    border-width: 15px 0 0 15px;
}

.ribbon span:after {
    right: 0;
    border-width: 15px 15px 0 0;
}
 ```

Then, on these pseudo-elements we mess around with their borders, and apply them a transparent color on some of the sides so we can create all those edges and even those shadows that we see on the ribbon .
