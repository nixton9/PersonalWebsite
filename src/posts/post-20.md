The well known parallax effect - where basically different elements move at different speeds when you scroll the page thus creating a cool depth effect - has been here for a while now. It was a huge trend like 4/5 years ago that is now slowly dying. Still, it's pretty common to see subtle and really small parallax scroll effects on some websites.

 ```html
<body>
        
    <div class="first-section section">
        <h1>This is the first section</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="second-section section">
        <h1>This is the second section</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="third-section section">
        <h1>This is the third section</h1>
    </div>

</body>
 ```

There are different ways of creating a parallax effect, some are more complex but get better results and others are simpler. Here i'll show you the simplest way possible to create a parallax effect that basically just uses one line of CSS!

 ```css
.section{
    position:relative;
    display:flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    color:#fff;
    width: 100%;
    height:100vh;
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center center;
    background-attachment: fixed;
    z-index:-1;
}

.section::before{
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    top:0;
    left:0;
    width:100%;
    height:100%;
    background-color: rgba(0,0,0,.4);
    z-index:-1;
}

.first-section{
    background-image:url('./1.jpg');
}

.second-section{
    background-image:url('./2.jpg');
}

.third-section{
    background-image:url('./3.jpg');
}

 ```  
Simply create an element - i used div's - that cover all of your screen ('width:100%' & 'height:100vh') and give it some background-image. Then, you only need to use 'background-attachment: fixed'. This is where the magic happens. It will make the background stay fixed on your element while to content on top of it will scroll in a normal way. This is what creates that parallax effect.  
Super simple, right? ðŸ¤“
