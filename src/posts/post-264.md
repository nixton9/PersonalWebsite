Hey guys, how are you? üòä‚úåÔ∏è

On today's tip we'll check how to easily redirect or simply refresh a page with an HTML meta tag.

This is super simple. By creating a 'meta' tag with the attribute 'http-equiv="refresh''' we can make the page refresh automatically. By passing a 'content' attribute we can set a timer for the page to refresh.

So if we use 'meta http-equiv="refresh" content="10"' the page will automatically refresh in 10 seconds.

```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="10;url=https://eduardo-araujo.com/tips" />
```

Another thing we can do is pass an URL on the "content" attribute and the page will redirect to that URL. With 'meta http-equiv="refresh" content="10; url=https://google.com"' our page will redirect to 'google.com' after 10 seconds.

And that's it! Have you ever used this meta refresh?
