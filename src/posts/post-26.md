Today I'm posting probably the simplest tip I have ever posted here but this is without doubt, of all my tips, the one I use the most!
Do you know when you need to center an element horizontally but it gets trickier than what it should be? We'll, just give a specific width to that element ( it can be width px or % ), apply 'margin:0 auto' and the element will be centered!

 ```html
 <body>

    <div class="box"></div>

</body>
 ```

I remember that when I learned about this my life just changed! ðŸ˜‚
Hope that, if you didn't know about this, it will be as helpful for you as it was to me.


 ```css
.box{
    background:url('./bg.jpg') no-repeat center center;
    background-size: cover;
    border-radius: 4px;
    width:80%;
    height:400px;
    margin:0 auto;
}
 ```

What about you? Do you use 'margin: 0 auto' a lot ? ðŸ¤”âœ‹
