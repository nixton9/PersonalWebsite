What's up guys? All good?  
Since we have a giveaway running at the moment and the prize is three domains for you guys, I thought this would be the perfect timing to make a tip on how to host a website online!

There are many, different ways of doing this. On this tip, I'll show you how to do this using your hosting's cPanel since I believe it's the easiest way to put a webpage online!

To start, you'll need to have a domain and a hosting plan already. If you haven't, make sure you enter the giveaway to have a chance to win one. For this tip, @howtekno hooked us up with a domain and a hosting plan. 

So, take a look at the video. We start on the main dashboard on the @howtekno platform. Usually, this is super similar in all other hosting companies. I start by visiting the website, only to see it not showing anything - by default it just shows a listing of the files in that directory. 

Then, we'll enter on the 'cPanel' and inside it we'll look for 'File Manager'. In here, we'll see some directories and files. We want to choose 'public_html'. Now, we just need to click 'Upload' and select the files we want or simply drag and drop them.

And it's done! When I go back to the website and reload it, I'm now able to see my page!
Hope this was helpful to you and let me know your doubts! üòÅüëä
