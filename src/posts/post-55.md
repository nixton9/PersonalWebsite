So, for today's tip I want to show you another 'not so used' HTML element: the 'small' tag.
This element is a really simple one and doesn't exactly adds a lot of functionality but still can be pretty handy for some cases.

 ```html
 
    <p>This is some normal text <small>and this is some smaller fine print.</small></p>

 ```

The 'small' tag is used to make the text one size smaller. This means that if a specific text is by default with 'font-size: medium' this will turned into 'small'. Usually it's used for disclaimers, legal text, copyright information or just some side comments.


 ```css
p{
    color:#007EFF;
    font-size: 1.6em;
}
 ```

Using it its obviously super simple: just wrap the text you want smaller on a '<small>' tag and you're good to go! ðŸ‘Œ
