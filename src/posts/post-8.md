Toggle buttons have been quite trendy for a while now. Whether it's for boolean fields on a form, or simply to toggle between a light and dark theme on your app, you can't go wrong with them. It's also a really cool way to spice up the old boring checkbox input, thus improving the user experience on mobile.

In order to this, we have to create a label surrounding a checkbox input and a span that we'll use for the circle and the slider.
We basically just hide the input, use the span to create our slider bar and set an ':: before' on the span to create the circle.

 ```html
 <div class="parent flex-center">
            
    <div class="toggle-switch-container">
        <label class="toggle-switch">
            <input type="checkbox">
            <span class="slider"></span>
        </label>
    </div>

</div>
 ```

Then, we have to set two properties to be triggered when the input is checked - the background color on the slider bar and the translateY on the span::before to move the circle to the right.
This will create a simple smooth animation to enhance the visuals.


 ```css
.flex-center{
    display:flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}

.toggle-switch {
    position: relative;
    display: inline-block;
    width: 60px;
    height: 30px;
}

.toggle-switch input {
    opacity: 0;
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
}

.slider {
    position: absolute;
    cursor: pointer;
    top: 0; bottom: 0; right: 0; left: 0;
    background-color: #007EFF;
    border-radius: 34px;
    -webkit-transition: .4s;
    transition: .4s;
}

.slider:before {
    position: absolute;
    content: "";
    height: 22px;
    width: 22px;
    left: 4px;
    bottom: 4px;
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 50%;
    -webkit-transition: .4s;
    transition: .4s;
}

input:checked + .slider {
    background-color: #F40AA1;
}

input:checked + .slider:before {
    transform: translateX(30px);
}

 ```

That's it, a clean and simple toggle to add that touch of flair to your projects ðŸ”¥
