Material design is a well known and widely used design system developed by Google. Using this system, Material UI was created - a opaen source library for reactJS that has a lot of ready to use components fitting this type of design. This is awesome to easily get started on a project, specially when you don't want to waste a lot of time on the design but still want things to look good!

To use this, I suggest you follow their 'Get Started' guide at material-ui.com. This guide is pretty simple and straightforward. You basically just need to install their library using npm or yarn and then you can start importing the components you want and easily use them!
